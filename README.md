## Full-Stack Web Development

This course has equipped me with the knowledge and skills to become a full-stack web developer. I have learned various front-end technologies, back-end development, and how to integrate them to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

The projects included in this repository demonstrate my proficiency in building web applications, handling databases, and creating user-friendly interfaces. I look forward to continuing my journey in web development and applying these skills to real-world projects.
